# Cricket Game Simulation

## Overview

This project is a Python-based Cricket game simulation that allows users to simulate cricket matches between two teams, manage player statistics, and participate in tournaments. The game supports different match formats (T20, ODI, Test) and includes features such as team management, strategy application, weather effects, and more.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Customize player attributes including skills, form, fitness, and mental strength.
- **Team Strategy**: Set batting and bowling orders, apply strategies for different match phases, and analyze performance.
- **Tournament Simulation**: Participate in group stages and knockout rounds with single and double elimination formats.
- **Match Simulation**: Simulate cricket matches with realistic ball-by-ball gameplay, including overs, weather effects, and stadium influence.
- **Statistics & Visualization**: Track detailed statistics for each player and team, and visualize match data with scorecards and performance charts.
